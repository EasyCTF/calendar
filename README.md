High School CTF Calendar
======

We love playing CTFs! This repository acts as a directory for high school CTFs. If you're organizing a CTF, we encourage you to add it to this directory so people will be able to find it.

Quick Start
------

Navigate to `_data/events.yml`. Create a new event by following this format:

```yaml
-
  name: YourCTF 2016
  start_timestamp: 1473667925
  organizer: CTF Team
  website: http://www.yourctf.com
  description: This is an amazing CTF.
```

You can use any CTFs listed there already as an example.

As there's no built-in mechanism for sorting these events, it's up to contributors to keep this in chronological order as best as possible. Place CTFs that happen sooner above CTFs that happen later, so it's convenient for people to find upcoming CTFs.

Thanks!
